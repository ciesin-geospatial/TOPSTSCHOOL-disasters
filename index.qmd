Welcome to the third module of the SCHOOL curriculum!

The Science Core Heuristics for Open Science Outcomes in Learning (SCHOOL) is part of the [NASA Transform to Open Science (TOPS)](https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science/) Training (TOPST) initiative, designed to teach the data science lifecycle using data from the NASA Earth Sciences division and to foster an inclusive culture of open science. You can learn more about the SCHOOL Project and other modules on the [SCHOOL Project home page.](https://ciesin-geospatial.github.io/TOPSTSCHOOL/)

This third SCHOOL module, titled "Disasters" explores natural and human-made hazards, examining the complex factors that lead to their occurrence, their impacts on communities, and the role of data in managing these events. Through several disaster-focused use cases, this module covers various examples and data sources, allowing learners to gain hands-on experience with real-world disaster data.

Each use case utilizes a unique dataset, guiding users through lessons on data access, analysis, and visualization, including techniques for data cleaning, subsetting, and creating impactful visualizations to share findings.

**This module is tailored to instruct undergraduate students and early-career researchers with some coding language exposure about the data science life cycle, illustrating how Open Science principles can be effectively applied to earth sciences, particularly in the context of water.**

The SCHOOL Modules do not intend to teach all-encompassing earth science lessons nor provide learners with total coding expertise. Instead, the SCHOOL Project aims to provide users with the skills to adapt the SCHOOL lessons to the usersâ€™ own Open Science workflow. To learn more about Open Science, explore [NASA's TOPS Open Science 101 Curriculum](https://openscience101.org/). To explore other themes in the SCHOOL project, visit our [Modules Page](https://ciesin-geospatial.github.io/TOPSTSCHOOL/modules.html).

Module 3: Disaster datasets and use cases cover:

- **Geospatial Analysis of Canadian Wildfire Impacts: A Multi-sensor Approach**  
   This lesson focuses on the 2023 Yellowknife wildfire evacuation, using satellite-derived data to understand conditions that led to the evacuation of 20,000 residents.  
    - [Lesson 1: Analyzing Wildfire Impact Using NASA FIRMS and NOAA GOES-18 Data](https://ciesin-geospatial.github.io/TOPSTSCHOOL-disasters/m302-wildfire-assessment.html)
- **More Lessons coming soon...**
