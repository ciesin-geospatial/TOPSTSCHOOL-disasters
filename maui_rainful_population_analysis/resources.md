## Precipitation Data

- **MesoWest Hawaii**
  - [MesoWest Hawaii Map](https://mesowest.utah.edu/cgi-bin/droman/mesomap.cgi?state=HI&rawsflag=3)
  - Real-time and historical weather station data for Hawaii, including rainfall. Select Maui stations, view recent rain totals, and download CSVs for analysis.

- **NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI)**
  - [NOAA NCEI Data Access](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access)
  - Official archive for U.S. climate and weather data, including daily and hourly precipitation records. Data can be accessed via web interface or API.

- **National Weather Service (NWS) Precipitation**
  - [NWS Daily Precipitation](https://www.weather.gov/marfc/DailyPrecipitation)
  - Daily precipitation reports from the National Weather Service. For Hawaii, use the Honolulu WFO for local data.

## Remote Sensing Data

- **Landsat Imagery**
  - [Landsat Band Combination Tool](https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/apps/bandcombination/)
  - Visualize and select band combinations for Landsat imagery (e.g., for NDWI/NDVI analysis). Download images from USGS Earth Explorer or similar portals.

- **MODIS Imagery**
  - [MODIS Home](https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov)
  - MODIS provides near-daily global imagery for vegetation, surface reflectance, and water mapping. Data available for download and analysis.

## Google Earth Engine Datasets

- **MODIS in Earth Engine**
  - [Earth Engine MODIS Datasets](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/modis)
  - Access MODIS surface reflectance, land cover, and water products directly in Google Earth Engine for cloud-based analysis.

- **Landsat in Earth Engine**
  - [Earth Engine Landsat Datasets](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/landsat)
  - Access all Landsat missions and process imagery for NDWI, NDVI, and change detection in Google Earth Engine.

## Additional Resources

- **Rainfall Atlas of Hawai ªi**
  - [Rainfall Atlas](https://www.hawaii.edu/climate-data-portal/rainfall-atlas/)
  - High-resolution, gridded rainfall climatology for the Hawaiian Islands, useful for spatial context and validation.

- **Google Earth Engine Python API**
  - [Earth Engine Python Install Guide](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/python_install)
  - Instructions for installing and using the Earth Engine Python API for remote sensing analysis.

## How to Use These Resources

- Download precipitation data (CSV or API) for Maui for the event period.
- Download or process Landsat and MODIS imagery for Maui before and after the January 2024 rainstorm.
- Use Google Earth Engine for advanced, cloud-based analysis and visualization.
- Reference the Rainfall Atlas for long-term rainfall patterns.
