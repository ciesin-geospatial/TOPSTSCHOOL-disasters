# Maui Rainfall Analysis â€“ January 2024

## Overview

This folder contains data, code, and documentation for the analysis of the January 16, 2024, rainstorm event in Maui, Hawaii. The goal is to assess the impacts of this extreme rainfall event using remote sensing, ground-based precipitation data, and demographic information, following the disaster lifecycle framework.

## Contents

- **precipitation_data.ipynb**  
  Jupyter notebook for accessing, processing, and visualizing precipitation data from NOAA NCEI and MesoWest.

- **ndwi_maps.py**  
  Python script for calculating NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index) using Landsat and MODIS imagery to map flooded areas.

- **resources.md**  
  A curated list of data sources and relevant links for precipitation, remote sensing, and Earth Engine datasets.

- **summary.md**  
  Brief summary of findings, key maps, and recommendations for disaster preparedness and recovery.

## Data Sources

- **Precipitation Data**
  - [MesoWest Hawaii](https://mesowest.utah.edu/cgi-bin/droman/mesomap.cgi?state=HI&rawsflag=3)
  - [NOAA NCEI](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access)
  - [NWS Daily Precipitation](https://www.weather.gov/marfc/DailyPrecipitation)

- **Remote Sensing**
  - [Landsat Band Combinations](https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/apps/bandcombination/)
  - [MODIS Home](https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov)

## Methods

1. **Data Ingestion:**  
   Downloaded precipitation records from ground stations and satellite sources for Maui during January 2024.

2. **Remote Sensing Analysis:**  
   Processed Landsat and MODIS imagery to calculate NDWI and map flood extent before and after the rainstorm.

3. **Integration:**  
   Combined precipitation and flood maps with census tract data to estimate population exposure and vulnerability.

4. **Outputs:**  
   Generated maps, charts, and summary statistics to inform disaster response and recovery strategies.

## How to Use

- Open `precipitation_data.ipynb` to explore and visualize rainfall data.
- Run `ndwi_maps.py` to generate flood extent maps from satellite imagery.
- See `resources.md` for a full list of data sources and access instructions.
- Review `summary.md` for main findings and recommendations.
